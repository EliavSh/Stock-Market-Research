## Project Pipline
1. Data Collection: Interactive Brokers API + Python Script --> InfluxDB on Docker container 
 * Couple months of 5 minutes resolution. params: Open, Close, High, Low, Volume.
2. PreProcess: Filter, Interpolation, Normalization, Feature engineering 
3. Process (Models): HATS implementation
4. PostProcess - tensorboard visualization: params and graph

## Sample Results
Comparison between different sets of the parameters:  <br>
* 'prediction_interval' - the amount of timestamps into the future of trend prediction
* 'look_back' - the amount of timestamps from the past we consider relevant for the prediciton
* 'min_max_norm_back' - the amount of timestamps from the past we use to norm (min-max normalization) the data
